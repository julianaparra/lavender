        <h3 style="margin-left: 15px;"> Who We Are & Our Vision </h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> Our names are Juliana, Colleen, and Alaya and we're three girls who met at Girls Who Code and decided to create this website as our final project! Our aim was to create a safe, inclusive, non-judgemental space for LGBTQ+ -indentifying individuals to give and receive advice and learn about their community. We also wanted to create an adaptable space determined by its users (hence the feedback page) and to have it provide a wide variety of sources and information about the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 15px;"> What in the heck is Lavender? </h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> We named our site "Lavender" because of lavender linguistics, a term for the particular ways members of the LGBTQ+ community speak amongst each other, including speech patterns, pronunciation, certain vocabulary, as well as slang. </p>
